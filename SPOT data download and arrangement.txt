The website provide multiple datasets https://land.copernicus.eu/global/
To download data is quite easy:

(2) by click the superlink under the Access column, enter the datapool
(3) register your own account
(4) select the data you need by date, extent, format, layer, etc....(note Geotiff can exact the extent by enter the country name)
(5) after the data request is submitted, wait until it show completed
(6) !!!!download data is quite easy by using FTP software FileZilla (a free software)

Very first steps to arrange the huge datasets ( it looks a little complex, 'cause the data was packed into .zip):
(1) Ctrl-A select all .zip folders, and then right-click unpack these .zip
(2) search " .tiff" in the Windows system search function
